Thanks for using the multitool. Here's what's new in v0.10.0-beta
	-The Klaval multitool features work now, kinda
		The multitool uses the original bat files for most of it, though the passwords are now more secure then in the standalone Klaval Multitool
	-MAJOR BUGFIXES
		Uh, I dunno, the Klaval features actually work now. That's a start. They worked in the original, I mean the Python rewrite.
	-This may or may not change, but you now need the resources folder for... Resources. This is required by the Klaval half.
	-Included in the github, NOT the zip, there is source code with passwords removed for the very first time.
		THE SOURCE CODE DOES NOT FUNCTION, IT IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!
What's to come?
	-Even more features, like:
		-Caesar Virus Loader
		-Links to more helpful sites
		-Hacking group chat links
